    description: "Just like all the other emotions we feel -- joy, happiness, sadness, grief, frustration, love -- we have a natural tendency to express, to emote. Anger is another form on that spectrum of self-expression. Yet, we don't. We are taught that anger is BAD, that we shouldn't be or feel angry. So we stifle, suppress, and ignore it. Just as we can't suppress joy or sadness, we need to let anger out. It is HEALTHY to express it (in a contained way without harming self or others, of course). The Lion's Breath is a great way to vent and depressurize. Do 3-5 rounds each time when you feel a mounting pressure within you of frustration, stress, overwhelm, or anger. ",
